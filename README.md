# NishantParhiBot

This is my first Telegram Bot, which basically is a chatbot. But as you see the dir Terminal_Bot, It is a bridge to specific address(Nishantparhi) and allows the user to access the terminal using Telegram.

To run the script you need some prerequisites:

	pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
    pip install telegram-bot
     
You need to Collect the TOKEN from BotFather bot on telegram. I have not integrated both the bots. So you need to use it separately for now.

### To-Do

* Integrate the bots to work together
* Add more commands to the chatbot
